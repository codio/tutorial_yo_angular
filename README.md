##ALLO! ALLO! LET'S SCAFFOLD A WEB APP WITH CODIO

**By Addy Osmani, James Cryer & Pearl Chen with Annotation Tutorial by Codio**

In this code lab, you build a fully functional  web application from scratch with the help of [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/). You'll also use features from [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/). The sample app will be written in [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).

Take a look at the image below. You can see the Codio IDE with 

- the step-by-step tutorial content in the right hand panel 
- your terminal and code windows on the left

So you can work your way through the tutorial really easily without having to switch windows or tabs.
